Best placed in its own family Platylophidae which has been recently formally described (Gaudin et al. 2021). However, an alternate name for this family,  Lophocittidae, may have precedence depending on whether Lophocitteae Kaup, 1855 is interpreted as having been originally introduced as a family-group name or as a genus-group name (Gaudin et al. 2021; Raty in litt. 9/10/21, Bird Forum https://www.birdforum.net/threads/crested-jay.323243/page-2)."

With this neotypification, superba Pennant, 1781 replaces feminina Ogilvie-Grant, 1915 which becomes a synonym. Use of Pennant, 1781 rather than Forster, 1781 for the author of superba follows the authors of the neotypification. See Irestedt et al. (2017). However, Elliott et al.
